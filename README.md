The code for a simulation.

# Forest simulation

## Evolution rules

- * At program initialization 5 bunnies must be created and given random colors.
- * Each turn afterwards the bunnies age 1 year.
- * So long as there is at least one male age 2 or older,
-  * for each female bunny in the list age 2 or older;
-      * a new bunny is created each turn. (i.e. if there was 1 adult male and 3 adult female bunnies, three new bunnies would be born each turn)-
- * New bunnies born should be the same color as their mother.
- * If a bunny becomes older than 10 years old, it dies.
- * There's a 2% chance that a radioactive mutant vampire bunny is born
- * Radioactive rabbits will bite and change exactly one non radioactive bunny into a radioactive vampire bunny every year.
- * (if there are two radioactive mutant vampire bunnies two bunnies will be changed each turn and so on...)
- * Radioactive vampire bunnies are excluded from regular breeding and do not count as adult bunnies.
- * Radioactive vampire bunnies do not die until they reach age 50.
- * The program should print a list of all the bunnies in the colony each turn along w/ all the bunnies details, sorted by age.
* The program should also output each turns events such as `Bunny Thumper was born!`, `Bunny Fufu was born!`, `Radioactive Mutant Vampire Bunny Darth Maul was born!`, `Bunny Julius Caesar died!`
- When all the bunnies have died the program terminates.
- * If the bunny population exceeds 1000 a food shortage must occur killing exactly half of the bunnies (randomly chosen)
 


## Foxes & grass

- * The forest has a maximum # of grass = 500
- * Every rabbits eats #2 of grass every turn
-   * Vampire rabbits eat #4 of grass every turn
- * If there isn't enough grass for all rabbits, all rabbits that don't have enough food, die
- * Every turn #1 of grass grows back

- Every fox eats #1 rabbit every turn, at random
-  * If there isn't enough rabbits for all foxes, all foxes that don't have enough food, die
-  * If grass is less than 20% of max, every fox has a 50% chance to eat an additional rabbit
- * For every **pair of male & female fox**, a new baby fox is born
- * Foxes live up to 20 years old and they can't be vampires
- * If a fox eats a vampire rabbit, it has 30% chance of death
- * When a rabbit is eaten by a fox, it becomes a ghost and haunts its murderer
-  * Haunted foxes cannot give birth for 5 turns
-  * When the 5 turns expire, "Ghost rabbit X goes to the afterlife!" - needs to be printed on screen.
  * The mother of a ghost, if she is still alive, after the ghost goes to the afterlife print the message "Mother X finally accepts the death of Y"

! Fox can hunt at age of 2
! Vampire rabbit when eaten don't became ghost
